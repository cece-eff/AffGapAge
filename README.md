This repo contains the code and files needed to reproduce our analyses. 
01_import data contains how we cleaned the raw data (unavailable because not deidentified) 
02_prep_data has code for the calculations needed for our variables
03_preregistered_analyses has code for the analyses that were preregistered. These do not include the CPT analyses.
CPT_bydecisiontype is a folder containing the code for cumulative prospect theory modeling collapsed across age group and then comparing the posterior distributions
CPT_bygroup&decisiontype is a folder contnaining the code for cumulative prospect theory modeling by age group (young, old) and decision type (affect-rich, affect-poor) and then compared.
Both CPT folders use the data file choicedata_greys_complete_ordered.csv and the files CPT_hierarchical_GEd_negative.txt and D8DA2E-utilities
